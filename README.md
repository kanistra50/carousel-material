# carousel-material

The assignment is to build A carousel as designed below that allows the user to navigate through the content from portfolio.json.

The solution has the following requirements:
The carousel should show the title and customer of the record.
The carousel can never show more than 5 items at the same time
Clicking the arrows to the left- or right of the carousel moves the items in the carousel one step aside
Clicking an item in the carousel makes it 'active'. It should stand out as 'Bonds' below and display the 'content' as text below the carousel. 
Once a user has 'seen' the data in particular tab a green checkmark should be shown
The carousel and the content displayed below should be in separate components
The carousel should look as much like the design as possible.
