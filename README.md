# carousel-material

The assignment is to build A carousel as designed below that allows the user to navigate through the content from portfolio.json.
[Carousel](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/carousel)

# The solution has the following requirements: 

- The carousel should show the title and customer of the record.

- The carousel can never show more than 5 items at the same time

- Clicking the arrows to the left- or right of the carousel moves the items in the carousel one step aside

- Clicking an item in the carousel makes it 'active'. It should stand out as 'Bonds' below and display the 'content' as text below the carousel. 

- Once a user has 'seen' the data in particular tab a green checkmark should be shown

- The carousel and the content displayed below should be in separate components

- The carousel should look as much like the design as possible.
